Additional sources
==================

Source for lib/rdoc/generator/template/darkfish/js/jquery.js (which is minified
and thus cannot be properly modified as is) is available at
debian/missing-sources/jquery.js.

When libruby* is installed, however,
/usr/lib/ruby/*/rdoc/generator/template/darkfish/js/jquery.js is a symlink
to jquery.js provided by the libjs-jquery package.
